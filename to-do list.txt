[ ] Link the height resizes of the text areas to one another (maybe resize the container and have the text areas fit to 100% the height of the container)
[ ] Make a width resize bar in the text area container (a bar in between the text areas that slides left and right, giving the text areas different amounts of the screen)
[ ] Add difference finding function in scripts (split text by '\n' into arrays and parse through the arrays)
[ ] Add a visualization of the difference with styled/colored text and line markers in divs
